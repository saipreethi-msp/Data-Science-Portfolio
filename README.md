# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project is accompanied by detailed documentation, including problem statements, methodologies, results, and insights gained.

## Projects

### [Machine Learning Model App: ](https://github.com/saipreethi-msp/ml-model)
An interactive Streamlit web application showcasing various machine learning models trained on different datasets. Explore the models and their performances live!
